    title: "About Me"
    content: |
      Kernel-level tinkerer & Embedded enthusiast. I specialize in bridging the gap between hardware and software. 
      With a deep background in Linux Kernel optimization and real-time embedded architecture, 
      I have a track record of squeezing every bit of performance out of distributed systems and intelligent controllers. 
      From refactoring kernel memory pools to designing millisecond-level scheduling, 
      I love solving complex "impossible" bugs at the OS level. 
      Excited to bring high-performance, power-aware firmware solutions to the Pixel Sensor ecosystem.
